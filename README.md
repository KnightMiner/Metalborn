# Metalborn

Metalborn is a mod inspired by [Feruchemy](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Feruchemy) from Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn. Unlike some previous takes on adding the concept to Minecraft, our goal is an approach thats a bit less faithful to the source material in favor of better integrating the design into modded Minecraft.
